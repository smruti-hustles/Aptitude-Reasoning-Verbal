# Partnership: Concepts and Model Questions for Placements

Understanding partnership problems is essential for various competitive exams and placement tests. These problems typically involve calculating the share of profit or loss based on the amount of capital invested and the duration of investment.

## Key Concepts

1. **Basic Partnership**
   - When two or more individuals invest capital in a business, the profit or loss is distributed in the ratio of their investments.

2. **Ratio of Investment**
   - If two partners invest \( A \) and \( B \) respectively, the ratio of their investments is \( A:B \).

3. **Time-Based Investment**
   - If partners invest for different durations, the share of profit or loss is proportional to the product of the capital invested and the time period.

4. **Profit Sharing**
   - The share of profit is calculated based on the ratio of their investments considering the time period.

## Common Types of Questions

1. **Equal Time Investment**
   - Problems where partners invest for the same duration but different amounts.

2. **Different Time Investment**
   - Problems where partners invest for different durations and amounts.

3. **Addition of New Partners**
   - Problems involving the entry of a new partner and recalculating the profit shares.

## Model Questions and Solutions

### 1. Equal Time Investment

**Question:**
A and B start a business with investments of $10,000 and $15,000 respectively. If they make a profit of $5,000 at the end of the year, how is the profit shared?

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the ratio of their investments:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{10000}{15000} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

2. Total profit is $5,000.

3. Share of A:
\[
\text{A's share} = \frac{2}{2+3} \times 5000 = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

4. Share of B:
\[
\text{B's share} = \frac{3}{2+3} \times 5000 = \frac{3}{5} \times 5000 = 3000
\]

So, A gets $2,000 and B gets $3,000.

### 2. Different Time Investment

**Question:**
A and B invest $12,000 and $18,000 respectively in a business. A invests for 8 months and B for 6 months. If they make a profit of $7,200, how is the profit shared?

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the ratio of their investments considering the time period:
\[
\text{A's investment} = 12000 \times 8 = 96000 \\
\text{B's investment} = 18000 \times 6 = 108000
\]

2. Ratio:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{96000}{108000} = \frac{8}{9}
\]

3. Total profit is $7,200.

4. Share of A:
\[
\text{A's share} = \frac{8}{8+9} \times 7200 = \frac{8}{17} \times 7200 = 3392.94
\]

5. Share of B:
\[
\text{B's share} = \frac{9}{8+9} \times 7200 = \frac{9}{17} \times 7200 = 3807.06
\]

So, A gets $3,392.94 and B gets $3,807.06.

### 3. Addition of New Partners

**Question:**
A and B start a business with investments of $20,000 and $30,000 respectively. After 6 months, C joins with an investment of $25,000. If they make a profit of $11,000 at the end of the year, how is the profit shared?

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the investment periods:
\[
\text{A's investment} = 20000 \times 12 = 240000 \\
\text{B's investment} = 30000 \times 12 = 360000 \\
\text{C's investment} = 25000 \times 6 = 150000
\]

2. Total investment:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{240000}{750000}, \frac{360000}{750000}, \frac{150000}{750000} = \frac{24}{75}, \frac{36}{75}, \frac{15}{75}
\]

3. Total profit is $11,000.

4. Share of A:
\[
\text{A's share} = \frac{24}{75} \times 11000 = 3520
\]

5. Share of B:
\[
\text{B's share} = \frac{36}{75} \times 11000 = 5280
\]

6. Share of C:
\[
\text{C's share} = \frac{15}{75} \times 11000 = 2200
\]

So, A gets $3,520, B gets $5,280, and C gets $2,200.

## Practice Problems

1. X and Y start a business with investments of $8,000 and $12,000 respectively. If they make a profit of $6,000 at the end of the year, how is the profit shared?
2. P and Q invest $7,000 and $10,000 respectively in a business. P invests for 10 months and Q for 5 months. If they make a profit of $3,500, how is the profit shared?
3. A, B, and C start a business with investments of $10,000, $15,000, and $20,000 respectively. After 4 months, B withdraws his investment. If the profit at the end of the year is $12,000, how is the profit shared?
4. D and E start a business with investments of $9,000 and $12,000 respectively. After 6 months, F joins with an investment of $15,000. If they make a profit of $18,000 at the end of the year, how is the profit shared?

By understanding these concepts and practicing these types of questions, you will be well-prepared for placement exams involving partnership problems.
