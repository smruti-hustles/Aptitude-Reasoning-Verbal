# Subject-Verb Agreement

## Basic Rule
The basic rule of subject-verb agreement is that singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.

- **Singular:** The cat **runs** fast.
- **Plural:** The cats **run** fast.

## Different Scenarios

1. **Subjects Joined by 'And'**
   - **Plural:** When two or more subjects are joined by 'and', they typically take a plural verb.
     - Example: Tom and Jerry **are** friends.

2. **Subjects Joined by 'Or' or 'Nor'**
   - **Closer Subject Agreement:** When two or more subjects are joined by 'or' or 'nor', the verb agrees with the subject closest to it.
     - Example: Either the teacher or the students **are** going to the event.
     - Example: Neither the students nor the teacher **is** going to the event.

3. **Indefinite Pronouns**
   - **Singular:** Indefinite pronouns like everyone, someone, each, either, neither, nobody, etc., take singular verbs.
     - Example: Everyone **loves** ice cream.
   - **Plural:** Indefinite pronouns like few, many, several, both, all, some, etc., take plural verbs.
     - Example: Many **are** called, but few **are** chosen.

4. **Collective Nouns**
   - **Singular or Plural:** Collective nouns (e.g., team, group, family) can take either singular or plural verbs depending on whether the group is acting as a single unit or as individuals.
     - Singular: The team **is** winning.
     - Plural: The team **are** arguing among themselves.

5. **Subjects Separated by Phrases or Clauses**
   - The verb should agree with the main subject, not with the noun or pronoun in the modifying phrase or clause.
     - Example: The bouquet of flowers **is** beautiful.
     - Example: The captain, as well as his crew, **was** injured.

6. **Plural Form Subjects with Singular Meaning**
   - Some nouns are plural in form but singular in meaning (e.g., news, mathematics, measles).
     - Example: The news **is** interesting.

7. **Titles, Names, and Quoted Words**
   - Titles of books, movies, and other works, as well as singular names or quoted words, take singular verbs.
     - Example: "The Birds" **is** a Hitchcock movie.
     - Example: Harry Potter **is** a popular series.

8. **Subjects with Quantifiers**
   - When subjects are quantified by amounts of time, money, distance, or weight, they take singular verbs.
     - Example: Five dollars **is** enough.
     - Example: Ten miles **is** a long walk.
