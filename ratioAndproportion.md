# Ratio and Proportion: Concepts and Model Questions for Placements

Understanding ratios and proportions is essential for various competitive exams and placement tests. These concepts are used to compare quantities and determine relationships between different values.

## Key Concepts

1. **Ratio**
   - A ratio is a way to compare two quantities by division.
   \[
   \text{Ratio of } a \text{ to } b = \frac{a}{b} \text{ or } a:b
   \]

2. **Proportion**
   - A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
   \[
   \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \text{ or } a:b = c:d
   \]

3. **Cross Multiplication**
   - In a proportion \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\), cross-multiplying gives:
   \[
   a \times d = b \times c
   \]

## Common Types of Questions

1. **Finding Ratios**
   - Determining the ratio between two quantities.

2. **Simplifying Ratios**
   - Reducing ratios to their simplest form.

3. **Proportional Problems**
   - Solving for unknowns in proportional relationships.

4. **Combined Ratios**
   - Combining multiple ratios to find a relationship.

## Model Questions and Solutions

### 1. Finding Ratios

**Question:**
The ratio of the number of apples to oranges in a basket is 3:5. If there are 15 apples, how many oranges are there?

**Solution:**
Let the number of oranges be \( x \).

Given the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5:
\[
\frac{3}{5} = \frac{15}{x}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
3x = 15 \times 5
\]
\[
3x = 75
\]
\[
x = 25
\]

So, there are 25 oranges.

### 2. Simplifying Ratios

**Question:**
Simplify the ratio 45:60.

**Solution:**
Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60, which is 15.

Divide both terms by the GCD:
\[
\frac{45 \div 15}{60 \div 15} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, the simplified ratio is 3:4.

### 3. Proportional Problems

**Question:**
If 4 notebooks cost $12, how much will 7 notebooks cost?

**Solution:**
Let the cost of 7 notebooks be \( x \).

Set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{4}{12} = \frac{7}{x}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
4x = 7 \times 12
\]
\[
4x = 84
\]
\[
x = 21
\]

So, 7 notebooks will cost $21.

### 4. Combined Ratios

**Question:**
The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4, and the ratio of girls to teachers is 8:1. What is the ratio of boys to teachers?

**Solution:**
First, express the ratios in terms of a common variable:
- Let the number of boys be \( 3x \).
- Let the number of girls be \( 4x \).
- Let the number of teachers be \( y \).

Given the ratio of girls to teachers is 8:1:
\[
4x = 8y
\]
\[
x = 2y
\]

Now, the number of boys is:
\[
3x = 3(2y) = 6y
\]

So, the ratio of boys to teachers is:
\[
\frac{6y}{y} = 6:1
\]

## Practice Problems

1. The ratio of the ages of A and B is 4:5. If A is 20 years old, how old is B?
2. A recipe calls for ingredients in the ratio 2:3:5. If you have 200 grams of the first ingredient, how much of the other two ingredients do you need?
3. If the ratio of the length to the width of a rectangle is 7:4 and the perimeter is 44 meters, what are the length and width?
4. The ratio of the number of boys to girls in a school is 7:9. If there are 630 boys, how many girls are there?
5. Two numbers are in the ratio 5:7. If their sum is 72, what are the numbers?

By understanding these concepts and practicing these types of questions, you will be well-prepared for placement exams involving ratio and proportion problems.
